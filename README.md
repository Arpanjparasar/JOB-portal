 # PROJECT DESCRIPTION
 # ===================
 Our project involved us to get familiar with the Android Development environment and thus develop an application 
 to serve as a personal companion to one. 
 So what our app does is fairly simple. It takes candidate details and find a Job that is suitable according to 
 his/her qualifications.

 # Features
 # ========
 We focussed our efforts to build an intuitive ,clean and simple UI. For the same, we encompassed card UI in our app. 
 We also implemented swipeable tabs so as to provide ease in navigating between different fragments.

The 'Sign up' activity allows the user to register himself in Job Vibe. This will allow the user to search and apply for Jobs. 
During the sign up process, the user must first enter a valid email address followed by a password of his/her choice(minimum 8 charaters needed).
After this process is completed, the user will be asked to fill some more blanks regarding his/her personal and education information.
